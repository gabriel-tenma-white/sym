# wordswap swaps labels if the pin is on the right side an looks like this:						
"# """"PB1 (CLK)"""". That's useful for micro controller port labels"""						
# rotate_labels rotates the pintext of top and bottom pins						
# this is useful for large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100 pins						
# sort_labels will sort the pins by it's labels						
# useful for address ports, busses, ...
